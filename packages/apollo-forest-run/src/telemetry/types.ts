// Event occurs when incoming write causes missing fields in watched operations.
// This happens due to a mismatching selection in the incoming operation and the affected operation.
//
// There are several situations when this can happen:
// - Incoming operation adds a new list item, but affected operation has some field in the selection
//     which is not present in the incoming operation, so it is impossible to complete the new array item.
//
// - Incoming operation switches field value of abstract type from one specific type to anoter (i.e. "__typename" changes),
//     but selection for another type of the affected operation contains fields in selection
//     which are not present in the incoming operation, so it is impossible to complete the object.
//
// - Incoming operation changes relationship between objects (i.e. changes value of some field
//   from object with id "A" to object with id "B"), but affected operation has fields in selection
//     which are not present in the incoming operation,
