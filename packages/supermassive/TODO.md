- [ ] Reimplement execution context so it extract implicit resolvers
  - [ ] Fix logic to use default values properly from schema
  - [ ] Alternatively, get rid of dependency on graphql-js and use some other way to parse scalars
    - [ ] Parsing in values.ts
    - [ ] Serializing in completeLeafValue
    - [ ] Maybe ban custom enum values
- [ ] In executeWithSchema
  - [ ] Remove \_\_type support
    - [ ] If you want to optimize, you can change the way we store types - currently it's just parsed AST

  - [ ] Remove AST document types - no longer needed
  - [ ] Make a function that uses extractMinimalViableSchemaForRequestDocument to add directive
